2. Short Description/Purpose
OVERVIEW OFCHURN AND WHY IT MATTERS
  Customer churn refers to the rate at which customers stop using a companyâ€™s products or services. In industries like telecom, where competition is high and acquisition costs are steep, retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

ðŸŽ¯ Target at-risk customers with retention strategies
ðŸ“ˆ Improve service offerings and customer satisfaction
ðŸ§  Make data-driven decisions for long-term growth
ðŸŽ¯ Objective of the Analysis
This analysis aims to:
-- Identify factors that influence customer churn within the telecom dataset
-- Discover key behavioral and demographic trends behind churn
-- Build predictive models to forecast churn risk
-- Segment customers into meaningful groups for targeted strategies
-- Provide actionable recommendations to minimize future churn
